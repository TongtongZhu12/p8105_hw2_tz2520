## Problem 1

### Read and clean the data

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

**Description of dataset**

The dataset `trans_ent` contains 20 columns and 1868 rows. The variables
include `line`, `station_name`, `station_latitude`, `station_longitude`,
route (1-11), `entry`, `exit_only`, `vending`, `entrance_type`, `ada`.
Data cleaning steps begin with data read, clean variable names, change
the type of variable of Route columns (8-11) to character, arrange the
sequence of columns, change the type of `entry` variable to logical.

These data are not “tidy”, because route number should be a variable.

### Calculate the number of distinc stations

**Number of distinct stations**

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 465 × 2
##    station_name             line    
##    <chr>                    <chr>   
##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
## # … with 455 more rows
```

**Number of distinct stations with ADA compliant**

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 84 × 2
##    station_name                   line           
##    <chr>                          <chr>          
##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle

## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
## # … with 74 more rows
```

**Proportion of station entrances / exits**

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
## [1] 0.3770492
```

**Number of distinct stations serve A train, with ADA compliant**

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct

```

**Summary**

There are total 465 distinct stations. There are 84 distinct stations
with ADA compliant. 37.7% of station entrances/exits without vending
allows entrance. There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of
the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

### Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
mr_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = 1,
    range = "A2:N550",
    skip = 1, 
    col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

### Read and clean Professor Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
pro_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = 2,
    range = "A2:M97",
    skip = 1, 
    col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = NA,
    year = as.character(year)) %>% 
  relocate(sports_balls, .before = homes_powered)
```

### Add variable to both datasets and combine them

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_new = mutate(mr_trash_wheel, wheel_type = "mr")
pro_trash_wheel_new = mutate(pro_trash_wheel, wheel_type = "pro")
com_data = bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_new, pro_trash_wheel_new)
```

### Calcualte the total weight of trash & total number of sports balls

``` r
sum(pro_trash_wheel$weight_tons)
## [1] 190.12
```

``` r
sum(mr_trash_wheel$sports_balls[which(mr_trash_wheel$year == "2020")])
## [1] 856
```

**Description of new combining dataset**

The new dataset `com_data` contains 641 observations of 15 variables.
The key variables include `dumpsters`, `year`, `weight_tons`,
`volume_cubic_yards`, `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`,
`cigarette_butts`, `glass_bottles`, `grocery_bags`, `chip-bags`,
`sports_balls`, `homes_powered` and `wheel_type`.

Compared with the original separate datasets `mr_trash_wheel` and
`pro_trash_wheel`, the new combining dataset include a new column
`wheel_type` to track the data from which trash wheel. `mr_trash_wheel`
is identified as `wheel_type` “mr”, and `pro_trash_wheel` is identified
as `wheel_type` “pro”.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12
tons. The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
2020 is 856.
